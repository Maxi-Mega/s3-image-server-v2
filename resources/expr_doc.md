# Expr Documentation

Some parts of the configuration leverage the use of [Expr](https://expr-lang.org),
a Go-centric expression language allowing for powerful transformation of data.

## Custom Functions

These additional functions don't belong to Expr's builtin library
and are meant to address behaviors that are specific to this project.
They can be distinguished from the standard ones by their `_` prefix.
